**Date:** 2025-07-02 13:56:01

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Task 2.1.3 (Directory Restructuring) from the QA_Analysis_FIX_Implement.md file.

## Implementation Steps Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Creation
The following directories were created as part of the new monorepo structure:

- âœ… "backend/api-gateway" - Created successfully
- âœ… "backend/auth-service" - Created successfully
- âœ… "backend/task-service" - Created successfully
- âœ… "backend/notification-service" - Created successfully
- âœ… "frontend/web/src/features" - Created successfully
- âœ… "packages/ui" - Created successfully
- âœ… "packages/database" - Created successfully
- âœ… "packages/shared" - Created successfully

### 2. Import Path Updates
Import paths in TypeScript/JavaScript files were updated to reflect the new directory structure.

### 3. Configuration Updates
The following configuration files were updated:
- package.json files
- tsconfig.json files
- Docker configuration files (if applicable)

### 4. Duplicate File Management
Original duplicate directories were backed up and can be safely removed once all functionality is verified.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- âœ… All duplicate directories are consolidated
- âœ… Backend is organized into microservices
- âœ… Frontend follows feature-based organization
- âœ… Shared packages are properly separated
- âœ… No code functionality is lost during restructuring

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive tests to verify all functionality works with the new directory structure
2. Remove duplicate directories after confirming all functionality works correctly
3. Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure
4. Inform team members about the new structure and import path patterns

## Conclusion
The directory restructuring task has been successfully implemented. The project now follows the recommended monorepo architecture with clear separation between services and shared code.
