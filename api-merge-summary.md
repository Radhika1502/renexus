# API Merge Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process of merging the \ackend/api\ and \ackend/api-gateway\ folders into a single \ackend/api-gateway\ folder.

## Steps Taken

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Compared the structure and contents of both folders
   - Identified duplicate files and directories
   - Identified unique files in each folder

2. **Backup**
   - Created a backup of both folders before making any changes
   - Backup stored in a timestamped directory

3. **Merge Process**
   - Merged package.json files, combining dependencies, devDependencies, and scripts
   - Copied unique files from api to api-gateway
   - Special handling for src directory to ensure no overwrites
   - Special handling for prisma directory, particularly schema.prisma
   - Special handling for jest.config.js
   - Created backups of files that needed manual merging with .api extension

4. **Manual Merging**
   - Merged package.json files
   - Merged jest.config.js files
   - Removed package-lock.json.api as it's auto-generated
   - Removed .env.api after reviewing

5. **Cleanup**
   - Removed the old backend/api folder
   - Updated references to backend/api in the codebase to backend/api-gateway

## Results

The merge has successfully consolidated the API code into a single location, which will:
- Reduce confusion and duplication
- Make maintenance easier
- Ensure consistent API implementation
- Fix import path issues in tests

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure everything works correctly
2. Update any documentation that references the old api folder
3. Review the merged files for any inconsistencies
4. Deploy and test in development environment
