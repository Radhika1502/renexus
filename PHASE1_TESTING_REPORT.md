- ✅ **Route Organization**: Separate route files for tasks, assignments, relationships
- ✅ **Handler Implementation**: Complete handlers for all CRUD operations
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Business logic properly separated
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Drizzle ORM integration ready

**✅ CRUD Endpoints Identified:**
```
POST   /api/v1/tasks              - Create task
GET    /api/v1/tasks/:id          - Get task by ID  
PATCH  /api/v1/tasks/:id          - Update task
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id          - Delete task
GET    /api/v1/tasks              - List tasks with filtering
```

### 1.2.2 Core Task Logic - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**✅ Assignment & Scheduling:**
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/assign` - Assign users to tasks
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id/assign/:userId` - Remove assignment
- ✅ `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id/schedule` - Set due dates and scheduling

**✅ Task Relationships:**
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/relationships` - Create parent-child relationships
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id/relationships/:childId` - Remove relationships
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/dependencies` - Create blocking dependencies
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id/dependencies/:depId` - Remove dependencies

**✅ Advanced Logic:**
- ✅ **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Logic implemented to detect and prevent cycles
- ✅ **Blocking Task Validation**: Status change validation when blocking tasks exist
- ✅ **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign key and constraint handling

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### ✅ Drizzle ORM Version Conflicts - RESOLVED

**Issue**: Multiple conflicting installations of drizzle-orm causing TypeScript compilation errors.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Created local schema files for each service
- ✅ Removed workspace dependency conflicts
- ✅ Updated import statements to use local schemas
- ✅ Fixed version compatibility issues

### ✅ Fastify Configuration Issues - RESOLVED

**Issue**: Outdated Fastify Swagger configuration causing compilation errors.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated to use separate @fastify/swagger and @fastify/swagger-ui packages
- ✅ Fixed configuration syntax for newer Fastify versions
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types

### ✅ TypeScript Configuration - RESOLVED

**Issue**: Restrictive rootDir settings preventing external imports.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated tsconfig.json to handle proper module resolution
- ✅ Fixed path mappings and import resolution
- ✅ Enabled proper compilation of all source files
