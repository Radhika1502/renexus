# Bug Fixing Process
## Phase 5.2.2 - Bug Fixing Process

This document outlines the standard operating procedure for addressing bugs in the Renexus application.

## 1. Bug Fixing Workflow

### 1.1 Bug Intake
- Bugs are reported through the bug triage system or directly from testing/users
- Each bug is assigned a unique identifier (BUG-ID)
- Initial triage determines priority and severity

### 1.2 Assignment and Scheduling
- P0 (Blocker) and P1 (Critical) bugs are addressed immediately
- P2 (Major) bugs are scheduled for the current sprint
- P3 (Minor) and P4 (Trivial) bugs are scheduled based on capacity

### 1.3 Development Process
1. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a bug-fix branch from the target branch (usually `develop`)
   - Branch naming: `bugfix/BUG-ID-brief-description`

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate and document the cause of the bug
   - Determine the scope of the issue (isolated vs. systemic)
   - Document in the bug report under Root Cause Analysis section

3. **Solution Implementation**
   - Implement the fix with minimal changes to meet the requirement
   - Add unit tests that would have caught this bug
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality

4. **Testing the Fix**
   - Run relevant unit tests
   - Add new regression tests if applicable
   - Verify the bug is fixed in a development environment

5. **Code Review**
   - Submit a Pull Request (PR) for review
   - Ensure PR contains proper description of the bug and fix
   - Address feedback from code review

6. **Fix Verification**
   - QA verifies the fix in a testing environment
   - Fix is validated against the original reproduction steps
   - Regression testing ensures no new issues were introduced

7. **Documentation**
   - Update the bug report with fix details
   - Document any API or behavior changes if applicable

## 2. Testing Requirements

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- Every bug fix MUST include unit tests that would have caught the bug
- Minimum coverage requirement: The specific code path that contained the bug

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- For bugs that involve multiple components, add integration tests
- Test the end-to-end flow affected by the bug

### 2.3 Regression Testing
- Run the full regression test suite before closing the bug
- Create specific regression tests for this bug to prevent recurrence

## 3. Fix Validation Checklist

- [ ] Root cause has been identified and documented
- [ ] Fix addresses the root cause, not just symptoms
- [ ] New unit/integration tests have been added
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Code has been reviewed
- [ ] Fix has been verified in testing environment
- [ ] No new issues introduced (regression testing passed)
- [ ] Bug report updated with fix details

## 4. Bug Fix Approval Process

### 4.1 Required Approvals
- Technical lead or senior developer code review approval
- QA verification approval
- Product owner sign-off for UI/UX or requirement-related fixes

### 4.2 Merging Process
- Merge bugfix branch into the target branch after all approvals
- Ensure CI pipeline passes after merge
- For critical bugs, consider cherry-picking to release branches

### 4.3 Bug Closure
- Update bug status to "Verified" after successful verification
- Close bug after successful deployment to target environment
- Document any follow-up tasks or improvements identified

## 5. Hotfix Process for Production Issues

### 5.1 Production Hotfix Workflow
1. Create hotfix branch from production/main branch
2. Implement minimal fix to address the specific issue
3. Add tests to verify fix and prevent regression
4. Conduct expedited review and testing
5. Deploy hotfix directly to production after approval
6. Merge hotfix back into develop and other relevant branches

### 5.2 Emergency Deployment Procedure
- Follow the emergency deployment protocol documented in DevOps guidelines
- Ensure proper communication to stakeholders before and after deployment
- Schedule immediate monitoring after deployment

## 6. Bug Fix Metrics

Track the following metrics for continuous improvement:
- Time from bug report to fix deployment
- Fix success rate (percentage of bugs fixed without reopening)
- Regression rate (new issues introduced by fixes)
- Code coverage improvement from added tests

## 7. Tools and Resources

- Bug tracking system: GitHub Issues / JIRA
- CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions
- Test frameworks: Jest, Cypress
- Code quality tools: ESLint, SonarQube
- Documentation: Markdown in repository
