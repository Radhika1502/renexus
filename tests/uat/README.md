# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Documentation
## Phase 5.2.4 - User Acceptance Testing Support

This directory contains resources, templates, and scripts to support User Acceptance Testing for the Renexus application.

## What is User Acceptance Testing?

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final testing phase where actual users test the software to ensure it meets their business requirements and is ready for deployment to production. UAT validates that the system works for user scenarios and can handle required tasks in real-world settings.

## UAT Process

### 1. Preparation

- **Test Environment Setup**: A dedicated UAT environment that mirrors production
- **Test Data Preparation**: Realistic data that reflects actual use cases
- **UAT Plan**: Schedule, scope, participants, and acceptance criteria
- **Participant Selection**: Identifying appropriate stakeholders and end-users
- **Training**: Brief training for participants on test procedures and documentation

### 2. Execution

- **Test Case Execution**: Participants perform predefined test cases
- **Exploratory Testing**: Participants use the system as they would in real scenarios
- **Issue Reporting**: Document any defects, usability issues, or suggestions
- **Daily Status Meetings**: Brief updates on progress and blockers

### 3. Analysis & Closure

- **Results Compilation**: Gathering all test results and feedback
- **Issue Triage**: Prioritizing identified issues for resolution
- **Acceptance Decision**: Go/No-Go decision for production deployment
- **UAT Sign-Off**: Formal approval from stakeholders

## Directory Structure

- `/templates`: Contains templates for UAT test cases, feedback forms, and reports
- `/scripts`: Automation scripts to assist with UAT environment setup and data preparation
- `/results`: Location for storing UAT test results, feedback, and final reports

## UAT Roles

- **UAT Coordinator**: Manages the overall UAT process
- **Technical Support**: Provides technical assistance during testing
- **Test Participants**: End-users who execute test cases
- **Stakeholders**: Business representatives who approve UAT results
