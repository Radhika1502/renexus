## Monitoring Tools

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification

### Application Monitoring
- **New Relic**: Application performance monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and reporting
- **ELK Stack**: Log aggregation and analysis

### User Experience Monitoring
- **Google Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **Hotjar**: Session recording and heatmaps
- **Custom Feedback System**: In-app feedback collection

## Alert Notification Channels

| Priority | Channels | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| P1 (Critical) | Phone Call + SMS + Email + Slack | Immediate (< 15 min) |
| P2 (High) | SMS + Email + Slack | < 30 min |
| P3 (Medium) | Email + Slack | < 2 hours |
| P4 (Low) | Email | Next business day |

## On-Call Rotation

| Week | Primary | Secondary | Escalation |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|
| July 1-7 | DevOps Engineer | Backend Engineer | CTO |
| July 8-14 | Backend Engineer | Frontend Engineer | CTO |
| July 15-21 | Frontend Engineer | DevOps Engineer | CTO |
| July 22-31 | DevOps Engineer | Backend Engineer | CTO |

## Reporting Schedule

| Report | Frequency | Audience | Content |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Health Check | Daily (First week) | Technical Team | System metrics, incidents, resolutions |
| Performance Report | Weekly | Technical Team + PM | Performance trends, optimizations |
| Executive Summary | Weekly | Leadership | Key metrics, issues, user adoption |
| Comprehensive Review | End of Month | All Stakeholders | Full analysis, recommendations |

## Incident Response Protocol

### Incident Levels

| Level | Description | Example | Initial Response |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Critical | System down, data loss | Immediate all-hands |
| 2 | Major | Feature unavailable | On-call team + SME |
| 3 | Minor | Non-critical bug | Assigned to on-call |
| 4 | Trivial | Cosmetic issue | Logged for next sprint |

### Incident Response Steps

1. **Detection**: Alert triggered or issue reported
2. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify appropriate team members
4. **Mitigation**: Implement immediate fix or workaround
5. **Resolution**: Deploy permanent solution
6. **Post-mortem**: Document root cause and preventive measures

## Post-Launch Optimization

Based on monitoring data, the following optimization activities will be prioritized:

1. **Week 1**: Critical bug fixes and performance hotspots
2. **Week 2**: Database query optimization based on real-world patterns
3. **Week 3**: Frontend performance enhancements
4. **Week 4**: Caching strategy refinement

## Success Criteria

The post-launch monitoring phase will be considered successful when:

1. System stability metrics remain within acceptable thresholds for 2 consecutive weeks
2. No critical incidents for 1 week
3. User adoption reaches 80% of projected targets
4. Support ticket volume decreases to <5 per day
5. All performance metrics meet or exceed targets
