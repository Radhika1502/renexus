  - Backlog
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Review
  - Done

### Time Tracking

- Daily time logging in GitHub Projects
- Weekly time summary reports
- Burndown charts for each sprint

### Documentation

- All project documentation stored in the `docs` directory
- Technical documentation in Markdown format
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

### Communication

- Daily standup meetings (15 minutes)
- Weekly progress review (1 hour)
- Bi-weekly stakeholder updates (30 minutes)
- Slack for daily communication
- Email for formal communications

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - `feature/[feature-name]`
   - `bugfix/[bug-name]`
   - `hotfix/[hotfix-name]`
   - `release/[version]`

2. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create PR with description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Assign reviewers
   - Pass CI checks
   - Get approval from at least one reviewer
   - Merge to main branch

3. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch
   - Run full test suite
   - Generate release notes
   - Tag release
   - Deploy to production

### Code Quality

- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for E2E testing
- Minimum 80% test coverage

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Structure

- 2-week sprints
- Sprint planning on first Monday
- Sprint review on last Friday
- Daily standups at 10:00 AM

### Sprint Planning Process

1. Prioritize backlog items
2. Estimate effort using story points
3. Determine sprint capacity
4. Select items for sprint
5. Break down into tasks
6. Assign tasks to team members

### Sprint Review Process

1. Demo completed features
2. Review sprint metrics
3. Discuss challenges and learnings
4. Plan for next sprint

## Progress Tracking

### Key Metrics

- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Burndown**: Remaining work over time
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs per feature
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests

### Reporting

- **Daily**: Standup updates
- **Weekly**: Sprint progress report
- **Bi-weekly**: Stakeholder update
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive project review

### Progress Visualization

- Burndown charts
- Velocity charts
- Kanban board
- Gantt chart for overall timeline
