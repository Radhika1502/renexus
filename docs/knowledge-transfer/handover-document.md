# Renexus Project Handover Document

## Project Overview

Renexus is a comprehensive project and task management platform designed to help teams collaborate, track progress, and deliver projects successfully. This handover document serves as a formal transfer of knowledge and project responsibilities.

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React with Next.js
- **Repository**: `frontend` directory in main repo
- **Build System**: Webpack with custom configuration
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express
- **Repository**: `backend` directory in main repo
- **API Style**: RESTful with some GraphQL endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Database Access**: Prisma ORM

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- **Caching Layer**: Redis 6
- **Replication**: Primary with two read replicas
- **Backup System**: Automated daily backups to cloud storage

### DevOps
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Environments**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized with Docker and Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Critical Paths

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. API validates credentials against database
3. JWT token generated and returned to client
4. Frontend stores token in secure storage
5. Token included in Authorization header for subsequent requests

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Data ingestion via API endpoints
2. Validation using Joi schema
3. Processing in service layer
4. Storage in PostgreSQL
5. Cache invalidation in Redis
6. Notifications via WebSockets

### Deployment Process
1. Code pushed to GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggered
3. Tests, linting, and build executed
4. Artifacts stored in registry
5. Deployment to target environment
6. Post-deployment verification

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

| Issue | Description | Priority | Planned Resolution |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
