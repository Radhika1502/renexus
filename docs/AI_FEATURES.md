## Workflow Automation

### Overview

The Workflow Automation service provides AI-powered suggestions for task management, including task assignments, prioritization, and status updates based on project data and team member workload.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Task Assignment**: Suggests the best team member for unassigned tasks based on expertise, workload, and past performance
- **Task Prioritization**: Identifies stalled tasks and suggests prioritization changes
- **Status Update Automation**: Recommends status changes when subtasks are completed
- **Workload Balancing**: Analyzes team member workload and suggests task redistribution

### Implementation Details

The workflow automation system uses a combination of:

- Historical task completion data
- Team member expertise profiles
- Current workload analysis
- Task dependency mapping

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Get workflow suggestions for a project
const suggestions = await workflowService.generateSuggestions(projectId);

// Apply a specific suggestion
await workflowService.applySuggestion(suggestionId);

// Dismiss a suggestion
await workflowService.dismissSuggestion(suggestionId);
```

## Task Analytics

### Overview

The Task Analytics service provides insights into task performance, completion trends, and time tracking to help teams improve estimation and delivery.

### Key Features

- **Time Tracking Analysis**: Compares estimated vs. actual time spent on tasks
- **Completion Trends**: Analyzes task completion patterns over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates efficiency and accuracy of time estimates
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Highlights tasks that are blocking project progress

### Implementation Details

Task analytics are calculated using:

- Time logs associated with tasks
- Task status history
- Project timelines and milestones
- Team member contributions

### Performance Optimizations

The task analytics service has been optimized for performance:

- Uses SQL aggregation for efficient data processing
- Implements caching for frequently accessed analytics
- Batches database queries to reduce overhead
- Uses date truncation for time-series data

## Team Analytics

### Overview

The Team Analytics service provides insights into team performance, workload distribution, and collaboration patterns.

### Key Features

- **Workload Distribution**: Visualizes current workload across team members
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks individual and team velocity
- **Collaboration Analysis**: Identifies collaboration patterns and dependencies
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Highlights areas where team skills may need enhancement

### Implementation Details

Team analytics leverage:

- Task assignment history
- Time tracking data
- Project completion metrics
- Cross-team collaboration data

## API Reference

### Workflow Automation Endpoints

#### GET /projects/:projectId/suggestions

Returns AI-generated workflow suggestions for a specific project.

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "suggestion-123",
    "type": "ASSIGNMENT",
    "taskId": "task-456",
    "suggestion": "Assign to John Doe",
    "reason": "John has completed 5 similar tasks efficiently",
    "data": {
      "assigneeId": "user-789"
    }
  }
]
```

#### POST /projects/suggestions/:suggestionId/apply

Applies a specific workflow suggestion.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "accept": true
}
```

### Task Analytics Endpoints

#### GET /tasks/:taskId/analytics

Returns analytics for a specific task.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "timeSpent": {
    "estimated": 8,
    "actual": 10.5
  },
  "completionTrends": [
    {
      "date": "2025-06-01",
      "completed": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Team Analytics Endpoints

#### GET /teams/:teamId/analytics

Returns analytics for a specific team.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "workload": {
    "user-123": 24,
    "user-456": 16
  },
  "velocity": {
    "current": 12,
    "average": 10
  }
}
```

## Integration Guide

### Frontend Integration

To integrate AI features with the frontend:

1. **Workflow Suggestions Component**:
   ```tsx
   import { useWorkflowSuggestions } from '@/hooks/useWorkflowSuggestions';
   
   const WorkflowSuggestions = ({ projectId }) => {
     const { suggestions, isLoading, applySuggestion } = useWorkflowSuggestions(projectId);
     
     // Render suggestions UI
   };
   ```

2. **Task Analytics Dashboard**:
   ```tsx
   import { useTaskAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useTaskAnalytics';
   
   const TaskAnalytics = ({ taskId }) => {
     const { analytics, isLoading } = useTaskAnalytics(taskId);
     
     // Render analytics charts and metrics
   };
   ```

### Backend Integration

To extend AI capabilities:

1. Add new suggestion types to `WorkflowAutomationService`
2. Implement additional analytics metrics in `TaskAnalyticsService`
3. Extend team performance calculations in `TeamAnalyticsService`

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use SQL aggregations instead of in-memory processing
   - Limit result sets to necessary data
   - Use indexes on frequently queried fields

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache analytics results with appropriate TTL
   - Invalidate cache on relevant data changes
   - Use Redis for distributed caching

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process analytics in background jobs
   - Update metrics on a schedule rather than on-demand
   - Use pagination for large result sets

### Monitoring

Monitor these key metrics to ensure optimal performance:

- Query execution time
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- API response times
- Database load during analytics calculations

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future releases:

1. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast project completion based on current velocity
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Generate textual insights from project data
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in task completion or team performance
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest process improvements based on historical data
5. **Integration with External Tools**: Connect with third-party project management tools
