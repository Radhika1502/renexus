# Phase 1 Critical Fixes Implementation

This document provides an overview of the Phase 1 critical fixes implemented for the Renexus project.

## 1. Directory Restructuring

### Overview

The project has been restructured into a monorepo architecture to improve code organization, eliminate duplicate directories, and establish clear boundaries between different parts of the application.

### Key Changes

- **Consolidated Directory Structure**: Eliminated duplicate directories and established a clear hierarchy
- **Separation of Backend Microservices**: Each backend service now has its own dedicated directory
- **Feature-Based Frontend Organization**: Frontend code is now organized by feature
- **Centralized Shared Packages**: Common code is now in a dedicated packages directory

### New Directory Structure

```
renexus/
├── apps/                  # Application code
│   ├── backend/           # Backend services
│   │   ├── api/           # Main API service
│   │   ├── auth/          # Authentication service
│   │   ├── notifications/ # Notification service
│   │   └── tasks/         # Task management service
│   └── frontend/          # Frontend applications
│       └── web/           # Web application
├── packages/              # Shared packages
│   ├── database/          # Database models and migrations

│   │   └── utils/         # Shared utility functions
│   └── ui/                # Shared UI components
├── tools/                 # Development and build tools
├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── .github/               # GitHub workflows and templates
```

### Migration Process

1. Created a new directory structure according to the monorepo design
2. Migrated files from the old structure to the new one
3. Updated import paths to reflect the new structure
4. Created package.json files for each package
5. Created a root package.json for the monorepo

### Developer Guidelines

- **Import Paths**: Use the path aliases defined in tsconfig.base.json (e.g., `@apps/frontend/web`, `@packages/shared/types`)
- **Adding New Features**: Place them in the appropriate feature directory
- **Shared Code**: If code is used by multiple services or features, move it to the packages directory

## 2. Offline Sync Support

### Overview

Implemented a comprehensive offline synchronization system that allows users to continue working with the application even when they are offline. Changes made while offline are queued and synchronized with the server when the connection is restored.

### Key Components

#### OfflineManager Service

A singleton service that manages all offline operations and data caching.

**Location**: `apps/frontend/web/src/services/offline/OfflineManager.ts`

**Features**:
- Detects online/offline status
- Manages a queue of pending operations
- Caches data for offline access
- Implements retry logic for failed operations
- Automatically synchronizes when connection is restored
- Emits events for UI components to respond to

#### useOfflineSync Hook

A React hook that provides components with offline sync capabilities.

**Location**: `apps/frontend/web/src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts`

**Features**:
- Manages online/offline state
- Tracks pending changes and sync status
- Provides methods for storing and retrieving offline data
- Handles synchronization with the server

#### OfflineStatusNotification Component

A UI component that displays the current offline status and pending changes.

**Location**: `apps/frontend/web/src/components/common/OfflineStatusNotification.tsx`

**Features**:
- Shows offline status indicator
- Displays number of pending changes
- Shows sync progress
- Provides a button to manually trigger synchronization

#### Offline-Aware API Client

A wrapper for API clients that automatically handles offline operations.

**Location**: `apps/frontend/web/src/services/api/offlineAwareClient.ts`

**Features**:
- Automatically queues operations when offline
- Caches read operations for offline access
- Transparently handles synchronization

### Implementation Details

- **Data Storage**: Uses localStorage for caching and queuing offline operations
- **Synchronization**: Automatically syncs when connection is restored or periodically
- **Error Handling**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Event System**: Uses EventEmitter to notify components of changes

### Integration with Task Management

The offline sync functionality has been integrated with the task management feature to demonstrate its capabilities:

- **TaskListWithOfflineSupport**: A component that shows how to use the offline sync functionality with task management
- **TaskManagementPage**: A page that uses the TaskListWithOfflineSupport component
- **offlineTaskService**: An offline-aware version of the task service

### Testing

Unit tests have been created to verify that the offline sync functionality works correctly:

- Tests for online operations
- Tests for offline operations
- Tests for synchronization when coming back online

### Developer Guidelines

- **Using Offline Sync**: Import the useOfflineSync hook and use it in your components
- **API Clients**: Use the createOfflineAwareClient function to wrap your API clients
- **Offline Status**: Add the OfflineStatusNotification component to your layout
- **Testing**: Test your components with both online and offline scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across different network conditions
2. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect the new structure
3. **Integration**: Integrate offline sync with other features
4. **Performance**: Optimize offline data storage and synchronization
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Implement strategies for handling conflicts during synchronization
