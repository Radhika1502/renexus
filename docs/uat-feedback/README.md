# UAT Feedback Collection and Resolution

This document tracks feedback collected during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the Renexus application.

## Feedback Collection Process

1. Feedback is collected from UAT participants via:
   - In-app feedback form
   - Dedicated UAT feedback sessions
   - Issue tracking system

2. Each feedback item is categorized as:
   - **Bug**: Something not working as expected
   - **Enhancement**: Suggestion for improvement
   - **Question**: Request for clarification
   - **Usability**: Feedback about user experience

3. Each item is prioritized as:
   - **Critical**: Must be addressed before launch
   - **High**: Should be addressed before launch
   - **Medium**: Can be addressed post-launch
   - **Low**: Nice to have, will be considered for future releases
