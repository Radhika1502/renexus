# Renexus Bug Tracking and Resolution Guide

This document outlines the process for tracking, prioritizing, and resolving bugs in the Renexus application.

## Bug Tracking Workflow

### 1. Bug Identification

Bugs can be identified through:
- User reports
- Automated testing
- Monitoring alerts
- Manual testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT)

### 2. Bug Reporting

All bugs should be reported in the issue tracking system (JIRA) with the following information:

- **Title**: Brief description of the issue
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the problem
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered steps to consistently reproduce the issue
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Environment**: Browser/device/OS where the issue occurs
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence if applicable
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Impact**: How many users are affected

### 3. Bug Triage

Bugs are triaged daily by the development team lead and prioritized based on:

- **Severity**: Impact on system functionality
- **Frequency**: How often the issue occurs
- **Scope**: Number of users affected
- **Workaround**: Whether a workaround exists

### 4. Bug Prioritization

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| P1 - Critical | System down, data loss, security breach | Immediate | < 24 hours |
| P2 - High | Major feature broken, significant impact | < 4 hours | < 3 days |
| P3 - Medium | Feature working incorrectly, moderate impact | < 24 hours | < 1 week |
| P4 - Low | Minor issues, cosmetic problems | < 3 days | < 2 weeks |

### 5. Bug Assignment

Bugs are assigned to developers based on:
- Area of expertise
- Current workload
- Sprint capacity

### 6. Bug Resolution

The developer assigned to the bug should:
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify the root cause
3. Implement a fix
4. Write or update tests to prevent regression
5. Submit a pull request for review

### 7. Code Review

All bug fixes must go through code review to ensure:
- The fix addresses the root cause
- No new issues are introduced
- Code quality standards are maintained
- Tests are included

### 8. Testing

After the fix is implemented:
1. Automated tests must pass
2. QA performs manual verification
3. For critical bugs, regression testing is performed

### 9. Deployment

Bug fixes are deployed based on severity:
- Critical: Immediate hotfix
- High: Next scheduled release or hotfix
- Medium/Low: Next scheduled release

### 10. Verification

After deployment:
1. The reporter verifies the fix
2. The bug is closed only after verification
3. The fix is documented in release notes

## Bug Severity Guidelines

### Critical
- Application crashes or becomes unusable
- Data loss or corruption
- Security vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Complete feature unavailability

### High
- Major functionality impaired
- Significant performance degradation
- Incorrect calculations affecting business decisions
- Blocking issues with no workaround

### Medium
- Non-critical functionality issues
- UI problems affecting usability
- Performance issues with workarounds
- Incorrect error messages

### Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Minor UI inconsistencies
- Documentation errors
- Enhancement requests

## Bug Resolution Templates

### Bug Fix Commit Message
```
fix(component): brief description of the fix

- Detailed explanation of what was fixed
- Root cause analysis
- How the fix addresses the issue

Fixes #[issue-number]
```

## Bug Prevention Strategies

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for all new code
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

2. **Code Review**
   - Mandatory peer review for all changes
   - Use of static analysis tools
   - Regular code quality audits

3. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - User behavior analytics

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain a knowledge base of common issues
   - Document bug patterns and solutions
   - Update documentation based on support tickets

## Bug Analysis and Reporting

Monthly bug analysis reports should include:
- Number of bugs by severity
- Average time to resolution
- Common bug categories
- Recurring issues
- Recommendations for process improvements
