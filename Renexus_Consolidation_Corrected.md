## Final Summary (Corrected)

**Overall Progress: 35% Complete**

**The project is critically incomplete and does not meet the initial objectives.** While foundational elements like the database, authentication, and CI/CD are in place, major backend services are missing entirely. The frontend has been built out, but it is largely a non-functional shell due to the absence of the core **Task Management Service** and a fully-featured **Project Management Service**.

**Key Deficiencies:**
- **Missing Core Backend**: The Task Management service is not implemented.
- **Frontend/Backend Desync**: The frontend is significantly ahead of the backend, leading to a non-functional UI for many features.
- **Incomplete Features**: Project Management, AI/Analytics, and advanced Security/Performance features are either missing or only partially implemented.
- **Lack of QA**: There is no evidence of a formal QA process, comprehensive testing, or bug fixing, despite the presence of testing frameworks.
- **Inaccurate Documentation**: The original status document was highly inaccurate, claiming 100% completion when the project is far from finished.

**The project is not ready for handover, UAT, or production deployment.** A significant development effort is required to build the missing backend services, connect them to the frontend, and implement a proper QA process.
